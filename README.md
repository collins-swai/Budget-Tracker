# iNetAfrica - Interview

## Description

Building a simple Flutter application that demonstrates your ability to create a complete and
polished mobile app. We want to see how you integrate with an open-source API and how you structure
and document your code. We would also like you to provide a brief document that describes your app
idea, any challenges you faced during development, and your approach to solving them.

# iNetAfrica Interview Test.

## Mid-Level Developer Pre-screening test

Timeline: 7 days

## Project Requirements
The application should be built using the Flutter framework.
The application should integrate with an open-source API.
The application should be functional and demonstrate your ability to create a complete and polished mobile app.
You should provide clear and concise documentation of your code.
You should provide a brief document describing your app idea, any challenges you faced, and your approach to solving them.
You should submit the code through a GitHub repository link.
You should include screenshots of the application.
You should also include an APK file for testing purposes.

## Quick Start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) [BLoC](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-bloc-for-beginners-839e22adb9f5) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
